# chordex
As a guitarist in my free time, i've come with an idea of making an web app named [ChordEx](https://chordex.net/) which is imagined to be a virtual songbook where you can write your own information about songs that you learn or make.

This repository shows frontend code <br>
Backend is visible here: https://github.com/Kristian383/backend_chordex

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
