# chordex
As a guitarist in my free time, i've come with an idea of making an web app named ##[ChordEx](https://chordex.net/) which is imagined to be a virtual songbook where you can write your own information about songs that you learn or make.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
